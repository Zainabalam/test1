**About Us**
In 2005, a few Muslim mothers in Orange County who were either homeschooling or seriously considering it created an email list to exchange ideas and resources. As the number of Muslim homeschooling families across Southern California grew, so did the need for something more organized and supportive.

In those early days, small groups of Muslim homeschoolers would gather for park days and informal meetups. While these gatherings offered much-needed connection, there was little structure or long-term planning. At one such gathering, the idea of forming a nonprofit effort was brought up as a way to share resources more intentionally, support one another in a deeper way, and build something lasting for the growing community.

Soon after, the founders Asma, Teyebeh, and Farhaana came together to start what would become Muslim Homeschool Network (MHN). What began as a simple email list evolved into a volunteer driven effort serving Muslim homeschoolers across Southern California.

Over the years, many homeschooling mothers have contributed in meaningful ways by sharing their time, talents, and experiences to help shape MHN into the strong, supportive, and faith centered community it is today.

MHN continues to support Muslim homeschooling families through educational, Islamic, social, and personal development opportunities, while also increasing awareness of homeschooling within the broader Muslim community in Southern California.
