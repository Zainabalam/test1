MHN aspires to assist Muslim homeschoolers in educating their children in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah through social, educational, and support programs, and to provide outreach to the larger Muslim community.

## Our Objectives

1. For children: Provide regular classes, workshops, events, field trips, and positive socialization opportunities

The organization hopes to meet the objectives through committees in the following areas:

* Educational Activities: Provide regular educational classes, events, and field trips throughout the calendar. (Eg. outdoor nature classes, Mathobotix, opportunities for students to share and present projects, basket weaving, sewing, etc. science classes, fairs, plays, and stage events.)

* Volunteer Activities: Work with local Muslim and non-Muslim non-profits such local mosques, Islamic relief, CAIR, to organize specific projects and activities for our homeschooling group. (Eg. packing brown bag lunches, beach cleanups, activism workshops, food bank harvesting, etc.)
