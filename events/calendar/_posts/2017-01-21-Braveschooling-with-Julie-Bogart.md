*Brave Writer is non-sectarian. Our instructors come from a variety of religious and non-religious backgrounds and so do our students. We do not promote one specific view. Because we work in the homeschooling world, we are aware of the importance of religious faith to many of our students. We do not seek to shape or direct the content of a student's writing or worldview. All worldviews, belief systems, and religious perspectives are honored and protected. The writer is guided in finding the best words and formats to communicate his or her worldview and/or beliefs powerfully, and with panache.
