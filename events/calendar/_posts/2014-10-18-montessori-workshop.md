**WHAT**:
#Workshop with Montessori Expert Barbara Bondurant
 
This workshop will provide an overview of the Montessori Methods for Reading, Writing, Math, and more! Barbara will go over tools and techniques that are hands on and sensory, allowing children to fully grasp concepts. The second half of the workshop will be a question and answer session. Although the workshop will be geared 3-6 year olds, the methods can be applied to older elementary students as well.
 
Barbara Bondurant has decades of experience teaching Montessori. After assisting and co-teaching with experienced Montessori teachers to gain practical classroom knowledge, and also attending Montessori seminars all over the country which gave more in-depth knowledge in subjects such as rhythm and music, geography, extra phonics training, and how to make many of the materials which are used and which at that time were not available for purchase, she opened her own Montessori preschool and kindergarten in Newton, Iowa. During her total of thirty eight years of teaching Montessori, she was responsible for conducting one to four Parent Education classes each year.
 
Barbara was trained by Ms Lena Wikramaratne, who trained under Maria Montessori from age eighteen until Dr. Montessori's death, helping to develop materials and some of the elementary curriculum. Barbaraâ€™s Montessori certificate for teaching three to six year olds (preschool through kindergarten) is signed by Dr. Montessori's son, Mario Montessori, who directed the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) after her death, and she was examined by an international team of Montessori trainers. Later, she also took the training for lower elementary Montessori, ages seven to nine.
