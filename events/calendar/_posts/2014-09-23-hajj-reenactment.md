**WHAT**: Hajj Reenactment with Dr. Ahmed Soboh!! The days of Dhul Hijjah are quickly approaching. Dr. Ahmed Soboh will inshaAllah be our children's guide through their Hajj (Reenactment). They will throw pebbles at the Jamaraat, run between Safa and Marwa, make tawaaf around the ka'bah, and more! The children will also have an opportunity to take part in a Hajj Game.
This year, children will also have the opportunity to present to their fellow homeschoolers about Hajj! Children write and perform poems and anasheed, act out a short skit or commercial, or write and deliver a short speech. They can pick topics such as the Prophet's (SAW) farewell sermon, Zam Zam, the story of Ibrahim (AS) and Ismaeel (AS), or the rites of Hajj. Each presentation should be no longer than 5 minutes inshaAllah. Sign up for presentations here.

\*Children older than the age range are welcome to register and attend.
