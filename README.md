# Muslim Homeschool Network website

This is a static website generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Most pages are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Updating the carousel

Update the [carousel data file](https://github.com/muslimhomeschoolnetwork/muslimhomeschoolnetwork.github.io/blob/master/_data/carousels.yml) to modify the list of carousel elements. Each element starts with a hypen as shown in the example below.

```yaml
- href: /events/calendar/2014/08/09/for-the-love-of-learning/
  image: /images/loveoflearningbanner.jpg
- href: /blog/2014/06/24/ramadan-calendar-project/
  image: /images/ramadancalendar.jpg
```

## Uploading images

Currently the Github web interface does not allow you to directly upload images, so you'll need to use the Github client for Mac or Windows. However, you can also use the following workaround for now:

1. Click [here](https://github.com/muslimhomeschoolnetwork/muslimhomeschoolnetwork.github.io/issues/7) and drag your image to the `Leave a comment box`.
2. Copy the markdown that was generated, you'll paste that wherever you want to put the image later. If you only want the URL (for the carousel for example) just copy everything inside of the parenthesis.
3. Click the `Comment` button to save the comment.

## Creating new posts

Click one of the following links depending on the type of post you want to add:

- [New blog post](https://github.com/muslimhomeschoolnetwork/muslimhomeschoolnetwork.github.io/new/master/blog/_posts)
- [New event](https://github.com/muslimhomeschoolnetwork/muslimhomeschoolnetwork.github.io/new/master/events/calendar/_posts)

You **must** name the filename using the following convention, otherwise your post will not appear. Do not forget the `.md` extension.

`FOUR DIGIT YEAR`-`TWO DIGIT MONTH`-`TWO DIGIT DAY`-`DESCRIPTION SEPARATED BY HYPENS` `.md`

Look at the existing examples before creating a new one:

* [Current blog posts](https://github.com/muslimhomeschoolnetwork/muslimhomeschoolnetwork.github.io/tree/master/blog/_posts)
* [Current events](https://github.com/muslimhomeschoolnetwork/muslimhomeschoolnetwork.github.io/tree/master/events/calendar/_posts)
