3. Check the [MHN calendar](http://www.muslimhomeschoolnetwork.com/events/calendar/) to make sure the event ***does not*** conflict with an MHN event.
(Go to [MHN calendar](http://www.muslimhomeschoolnetwork.com/events/calendar/) or [MHN yahoo group](https://groups.yahoo.com/MuslimHomeschoolNetwork), click on ‘calendar’ and check there). Avoid planning field trip on Fridays.
