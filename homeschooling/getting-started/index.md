##HOW TO HOMESCHOOL

Are you looking to learn more about homeschooling? Follow our step-by-step guide to getting started.  We have a lot of information here so be sure to pace yourself. Our Support and Outreach team is here for you and is happy to answer any questions you may have. 

####*1. To Homeschool or Not?

The first step to getting started is determining whether homeschooling is the best option for your family.  You will often hear homeschoolers espouse the benefits of homeschooling, but we recognize that there are challenges to homeschooling as well and that each family has to decide what is best for them.  [California Homeschool Network’s FAQs](http://www.californiahomeschool.net/howTo/faq.htm) about homeschooling is a great place to get some of your general questions about homeschooling answered.  

Want to hear more from homeschoolers themselves?  Read what one of our members had to say about her [transition to homeschooling](http://blog.babygizmo.com/2014/03/10-things-homeschooling-mom-miss-traditional-school/).  Then see her follow up article examining some of the [challenges of homeschooling](http://blog.babygizmo.com/2014/05/top-six-challenges-homeschooling/).  Here are two more articles listing the [PROS](http://www.weirdunsocializedhomeschoolers.com/homeschooling-pros-and-cons-part-2/#content) and [CONS](http://www.weirdunsocializedhomeschoolers.com/homeschooling-pros-and-cons/#content) to help you make the right decision. 

####*2. Determine Your Legal Options.

There is more than one way to legally go about homeschooling in the state of California.  Here’s a [Step-by-Step Guide](http://californiahomeschool.net/howTo/pdf/CHNJTF2012_13.pdf) to all your legal options.

####*3. Connect with Local Homeschool Groups.

####*4. Explore Educational Philosophies.

Once you’ve determined homeschooling is the right option for your family, it’s time to start learning how to actually go about doing it!  There are so many different ways to homeschool. Here is a breakdown of the various [educational philosophies](http://simplehomeschool.net/educational-philosophies-defined-part-i/).   

####*5. Write a Family Mission Statement.

Having a family mission statement is an invaluable tool to aid you in making the right decisions when it comes to choosing curriculum, classes or activities.  Sometimes the choices can be overwhelming and taking the time to write down what you want now will help guide you in making the best choices for your family.  Learn more about writing a family mission statement [here](http://www.mariannesunderland.com/2013/04/why-homeschool-how-to-make-a-homeschool-mission-statement/).  

####*6. Choose Curriculum.

With curriculum options aplenty, finding the right one for your family can seem like a daunting task. The author of -101 Top picks for Homeschool Curriculum-, Cathy Duffy, has a great [website]() that offers articles and reviews of other books. This is a must BOOKMARK for every homeschooler who wants a detailed review of curriculum they are looking into. 

[Homeschool Reviews](http://www.homeschoolreviews.com) is another great website where homeschoolers review the curriculum available.  

Of course, don’t forget to post your questions about curriculum on MHN’s email list!  

####*7. Set up a Homeschool Space.

Some people set up a separate homeschool classroom, some teach in the living room or on the kitchen table and still others take their learning outdoors.  Whatever you decide, you’ll need some space to store your homeschool supplies.  Clear off a bookshelf or make space in the closet, but be sure to set up a place to keep all your homeschool materials organized and on hand.  Check out [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=homeschool%20room) for lots of ideas on setting up a homeschool area!

####*8. Always seek help from Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’aala).

Throughout this whole process, don’t forget the most important thing: seeking help from Allah (SWT) every step of the way!  Remember to make dua for Allah (SWT) to guide you in making the best choices for your family.  We pray that Allah (SWT) helps you in this journey and makes it easy and beneficial for your family!
