As-salamu alaikum,

The COVID-19 outbreak and school closures have put many families in a completely new dynamic.  These are unprecedented times for all of us, especially for those who now have children at home from regular school. Muslim Homeschool Network (MHN) has compiled some tips and resources to continue our children’s education in light of the current environment, anxieties, and rapidly changing situation we are all facing. 

Please read our articles and blogs compiled by members, along with many more resources in our resources link.

As we all strive to adopt a new normal, we remember Allah’s promise to us that he will not task a soul more than it can bear. Let’s make the best use of this time and pray for everyone’s iman, health, and safety. 

With love and support,
