PANDEMIC! No, not the game, but reality. Everywhere you look, it's a mad scramble. Moms are especially stressed. The morning solitude is gone and suddenly YOU are responsible for your child(ren)'s day to day education. Mothers who work outside the home now have twice the load and half the time.

Wait, what just happened? I didn't plan for this!

Yet here we are, mandated to stay home until the crisis is averted. We are all homeschoolers now. Fear not. You can be more than a temporary teacher of facts and formulas until the schools take over again. Welcome to homeschooling!

Firstly, no two homeschools are alike. We respect that and stand by it. Home education is all about personalized education, tailored to the individuals that make it. Therein lies the challenge.

Second, we want to make it clear that you are not living in normal homeschooling circumstances. We do not stay home all the time. Social interaction is not severely limited. And no mother can work full time AND teach full time AND maintain her home full time. So keep your expectations to a minimum. Focus on what is essential to maintain a happy home, and leave the rest for later. 

Lastly, accept that there are uncertainties abound. How can I keep my children occupied? My spouse is working from home, can he cope? How can I make enough space for a classroom? What curriculum should we use? Is there a schedule to follow? Where can I find resources for specific ages? I've never taught anything, will my kids listen? When am I mom, and when am I teacher? Should I involve my husband?

The list of questions can be never-ending and paralyzing. But it doesn't have to be. We don't promise answers because only you know what is best suited for your family and home situation. But we can help you reach clarity and confidence in your decisions. Take comfort in the fact that the overwhelming majority of families who start on the homeschooling path never look back.
