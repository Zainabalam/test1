## MHN Email List
MHNâ€™s email list serves the homeschooling Muslims in the southern California\* area. Subscription is open to mothers who are:

1. current homeschoolers
2. seriously considering homeschooling\*\*
3. those mothers who have homeschooled in the past and are available as a resource for homeschoolers

\* Southern California includes Orange, LA, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties.

\*\*To ensure that the list maintains its focus on serving current and future homeschoolers, those new list members who are seriously considering homeschooling and have not yet started are required to attend at least one MHN event during the school year; we highly recommend our 101 seminars.

Remember, you must fill out the [membership form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kV8_aWOXPsqbrg8RO_Hg0L6kFPaGuJZLMDeafdSIBi4/viewform) in order to join the MHN email list!
